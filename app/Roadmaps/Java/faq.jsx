    question: "Do I need to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for Java backend development?",
    answer:
      "Yes, but focus on understanding how DSA applies in real-world Java problems â€” collections, searching, sorting, and optimization. You donâ€™t need to master competitive programming, but a strong grasp of logic and efficiency helps you write scalable backend code.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Java version should I learn in 2025?",
    answer:
      "Start with Java 17 (LTS) or later. Most companies are moving toward Java 17 or Java 21. The syntax and performance improvements are modern while keeping long-term stability and support.",
  },
  {
    question: "How important is Spring Boot for getting a Java developer job?",
    answer:
      "Very important. Spring Boot is the industry standard for building backend APIs and microservices. Mastering it â€” along with Spring Data JPA, Security, and Testing â€” will open most Java backend roles for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I learn Hibernate before Spring Data JPA?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. Spring Data JPA abstracts most Hibernate complexities, but understanding Hibernate concepts like entity lifecycle, caching, and relationships will help you debug and optimize effectively.",
  },
  {
    question: "What database should I use for my Java projects?",
    answer:
      "Start with PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational databases. Learn to integrate using JPA/Hibernate. Later, explore Redis for caching and MongoDB for NoSQL scenarios like analytics or document storage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I test my Java applications properly?",
    answer:
      "Use JUnit 5 for unit testing and Mockito for mocking dependencies. For integration tests, use @SpringBootTest or Testcontainers to test against real databases or services.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I learn Docker and Kubernetes as a Java developer?",
    answer:
      "After youâ€™re comfortable building Spring Boot APIs and using databases. Docker helps you package and deploy your apps consistently, and Kubernetes comes next for orchestrating microservices in production.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is learning Microservices mandatory for Java developers?",
    answer:
      "No, but itâ€™s highly valuable. Start with monolithic applications to learn core backend principles. Once confident, learn microservices, Kafka, and distributed communication to move into enterprise-level systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Whatâ€™s the best way to practice Java backend skills?",
    answer:
      "Build projects end-to-end â€” from API design to database integration, security, testing, and deployment. Each project should solve a real problem and include documentation, CI/CD, and Docker setup. Avoid only tutorials â€” build, break, and fix your code.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I become a Java developer without knowing frontend technologies?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many backend engineers specialize in APIs and system design. However, knowing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helps you test your APIs and collaborate better with frontend teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I make my Java projects stand out to recruiters?",
    answer:
      "Host your projects on GitHub, write clear README files, and deploy at least one live demo using Render, Railway, or Docker Hub. Add tests, CI/CD pipelines, and proper API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).",
  },
