// FAQ Data
export const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How long does it take to complete this entire roadmap?",
    answer: "The timeline varies based on your dedication and prior experience. Typically, Phase 1 takes 2-3 months, Phase 2 takes 3-4 months, Phase 3 takes 4-6 months, Phase 4 takes 3-4 months, and Phase 5 is ongoing. Complete mastery usually takes 12-18 months of consistent practice."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I learn multiple editing software or focus on just one?",
    answer: "Start with one software and master it thoroughly before moving to others. Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve are excellent starting points. Once you're proficient in one, learning others becomes much easier as the fundamental concepts remain the same."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need expensive equipment to start video editing?",
    answer: "No! You can start with free software like DaVinci Resolve or CapCut Desktop on a mid-range computer. Focus on learning the craft first. As you progress and potentially earn from editing, you can invest in better hardware and paid software."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between color correction and color grading?",
    answer: "Color correction fixes technical issues like exposure, white balance, and contrast to make footage look natural. Color grading is creative styling to achieve a specific mood or look, like the cinematic teal and orange effect."
  },
  {
    question: "How important is audio in video editing?",
    answer: "Extremely important! Poor audio can ruin even the best visuals. Viewers will tolerate average video quality but will quickly leave if audio is bad. Master audio levels, noise reduction, and basic mixing early in your journey."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I skip phases or should I follow the roadmap sequentially?",
    answer: "While you can adapt the roadmap to your needs, it's designed progressively. Each phase builds on previous knowledge. Skipping fundamentals often leads to gaps that become problematic later. However, you can adjust the time spent on each phase based on your goals."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of projects should I include in my portfolio?",
    answer: "Include diverse work that showcases different skills: a narrative piece showing storytelling, a commercial showing polish and brand work, a music video showing rhythm and creativity, and a documentary showing interview editing and B-roll integration."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I stay updated with the latest editing trends and techniques?",
    answer: "Follow industry professionals on social media, subscribe to channels like Peter McKinnon, Mango Street, and Film Riot. Join editing communities, attend workshops, and experiment with new techniques. The industry evolves rapidly, especially with AI integration."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the earning potential for video editors?",
    answer: "It varies widely. Beginner freelancers might earn $20-50/hour, experienced editors $50-150/hour, and specialized professionals $100-300+/hour. Full-time positions range from $40,000-120,000+ annually depending on location, specialization, and experience level."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I specialize in a specific type of editing or stay generalist?",
    answer: "Start as a generalist to understand all aspects, then gradually specialize based on your interests and market demand. Specializations like motion graphics, color grading, or short-form content often command higher rates than general editing."
