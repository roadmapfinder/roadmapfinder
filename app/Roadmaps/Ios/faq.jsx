    question: "Do I need a MacBook to start iOS development?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Xcode, the official IDE for iOS development, only runs on macOS. Youâ€™ll need a Mac to build and test iOS apps. Some cloud-based options like MacStadium exist, but having a Mac is highly recommended.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Should I learn UIKit or SwiftUI first?",
    answer:
      "SwiftUI is the modern framework and easier for beginners. However, UIKit is still heavily used in industry. Start with SwiftUI for projects, but learn UIKit basics if you want to be job-ready.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How important is Core Data for iOS jobs?",
    answer:
      "Very important. Many apps require offline persistence. Core Data is widely used in production apps, though alternatives like Realm and SQLite are also common.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Do I need to pay for an Apple Developer account?",
    answer:
      "You can build and run apps on your own device for free. But if you want to publish to the App Store, youâ€™ll need a paid Apple Developer account ($99/year).",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "When should I start learning advanced topics like Combine or async/await?",
    answer:
      "After youâ€™re comfortable with Swift basics, networking, and persistence. These advanced tools help you handle complex, scalable apps but arenâ€™t needed for your very first apps.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What kind of architecture should I use for my projects?",
    answer:
      "For small projects, MVVM is usually enough. For larger apps, Clean Architecture or VIPER is often used. Recruiters like seeing that you understand architecture patterns.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "How do I test my apps on real iPhones?",
    answer:
      "Connect your iPhone via USB and select it in Xcodeâ€™s device list. Youâ€™ll need to sign in with your Apple ID in Xcode. For advanced features like push notifications, youâ€™ll need a developer account.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How much Swift do I need to know before building apps?",
    answer:
      "You donâ€™t need to master the entire language first. Learn the basics (variables, optionals, functions, classes/structs, closures) and start building small apps. Youâ€™ll learn more Swift along the way.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Is publishing apps on the App Store necessary to get hired?",
    answer:
      "Not mandatory, but itâ€™s a big plus. Having at least 1â€“2 apps published shows employers you understand the full development lifecycle and App Store guidelines.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "What projects should I showcase in my portfolio?",
    answer:
      "Pick 2â€“3 polished apps that demonstrate different skills: a CRUD app (Core Data), a networking app (API integration), and an advanced feature app (push notifications, HealthKit, or Firebase).",
  },
