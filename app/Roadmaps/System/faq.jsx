  {
    question: "What is system design, and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and data flow of a software system to meet specific requirements. It ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability in large-scale applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you design a scalable system?",
    answer:
      "To design a scalable system, identify potential bottlenecks and use techniques like load balancing, caching, database sharding, asynchronous processing, and horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic efficiently.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?",
    answer:
      "Vertical scaling means upgrading existing machines (more CPU, RAM), while horizontal scaling means adding more machines or instances. Horizontal scaling is generally preferred for distributed, high-availability systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a load balancer and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck. It improves performance and reliability by monitoring health and rerouting traffic automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do databases handle large-scale data efficiently?",
    answer:
      "Databases use indexing, replication, partitioning, and caching to handle massive amounts of data efficiently. Distributed databases like Cassandra or MongoDB are designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is caching and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times. Itâ€™s crucial for performance in high-traffic applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the CAP theorem?",
    answer:
      "The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the following three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. For example, systems like MongoDB prioritize availability and partition tolerance (AP).",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you design a URL shortening service like bit.ly?",
    answer:
      "A URL shortener involves generating unique short keys using hashing or base62 encoding, storing them in a database, and redirecting users from short URLs to the original URLs. Scalability involves caching and database sharding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?",
    answer:
      "A monolithic architecture keeps all components in a single codebase, making deployment simpler but scaling harder. Microservices break the system into small, independent services, enabling flexibility and independent scaling.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure high availability in a distributed system?",
    answer:
      "High availability is achieved using redundancy, failover mechanisms, replication, and health checks. Load balancers and multi-region deployments also help ensure uptime during failures.",
  },
