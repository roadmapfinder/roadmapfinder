  // üß© Beginner
  {
    id: "faq1",
    level: "Beginner (0‚Äì2 months)",
    question: "Why do DevOps engineers need to learn Linux first?",
    answer:
      "Almost all servers and containers run on Linux. Understanding file systems, permissions, services, and networking in Linux helps you manage production environments confidently."
  },
  {
    id: "faq2",
    level: "Beginner (0‚Äì2 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the difference between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)?",
    answer:
      "CI focuses on automatically building and testing code after every change, while CD automates releasing the code to production environments. Together, they ensure faster and safer delivery."
  },
  {
    id: "faq3",
    level: "Beginner (0‚Äì2 months)",
    question: "Why is Docker so important in DevOps?",
    answer:
      "Docker standardizes environments by packaging applications and dependencies together. It eliminates the classic 'it works on my machine' issue, enabling consistent builds and deployments."
  },

  // ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate
  {
    id: "faq4",
    level: "Intermediate (2‚Äì4 months)",
    question: "How is Jenkins different from GitHub Actions?",
    answer:
      "Jenkins is a self-hosted automation server giving you full control, while GitHub Actions is cloud-native and integrated directly with GitHub. Jenkins offers deep customization, whereas Actions is easier to set up for smaller teams."
  },
  {
    id: "faq5",
    level: "Intermediate (2‚Äì4 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the purpose of using Ansible or Terraform when I can just use the AWS Console?",
    answer:
      "Manual setup via AWS Console doesn‚Äôt scale and isn‚Äôt reproducible. Tools like Ansible and Terraform define infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing versioning, automation, and consistency across environments."
  },
  {
    id: "faq6",
    level: "Intermediate (2‚Äì4 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the difference between Prometheus and Grafana?",
    answer:
      "Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects and stores metrics, while Grafana visualizes those metrics in interactive dashboards. They are often used together for observability."
  },

  // ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud / IaC
  {
    id: "faq7",
    level: "Intermediate (4‚Äì6 months)",
    question: "Why do companies prefer Terraform over CloudFormation?",
    answer:
      "Terraform is cloud-agnostic, meaning it supports AWS, Azure, GCP, etc., while CloudFormation is AWS-only. Terraform also offers a cleaner syntax and reusable modules, making it more flexible in multi-cloud setups."
  },
  {
    id: "faq8",
    level: "Intermediate (4‚Äì6 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the real-world use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?",
    answer:
      "IaC allows teams to create, modify, and destroy cloud infrastructure using code ‚Äî just like software. It ensures reliability, quick replication of environments, and full traceability through version control."
  },
  {
    id: "faq9",
    level: "Intermediate (4‚Äì6 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the difference between configuration management and provisioning?",
    answer:
      "Provisioning (Terraform) creates infrastructure resources, while configuration management (Ansible) installs and configures software on those resources. They‚Äôre complementary in a DevOps workflow."
  },

  // üöÄ Advanced
  {
    id: "faq10",
    level: "Advanced (6‚Äì8 months)",
    question: "Why is Kubernetes so widely used in production environments?",
    answer:
      "Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It enables resilience, load balancing, and zero-downtime rolling updates across clusters."
  },
  {
    id: "faq11",
    level: "Advanced (6‚Äì8 months)",
    question: "What‚Äôs the difference between Helm and ArgoCD?",
    answer:
      "Helm manages Kubernetes packages (charts) ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a package manager for K8s. ArgoCD focuses on GitOps ‚Äî automatically syncing the desired state from your Git repository to your cluster."
  },
  {
    id: "faq12",
    level: "Advanced (6‚Äì8 months)",
    question: "What does GitOps mean and why is it trending?",
    answer:
      "GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for deployments. Any change to infrastructure or app configuration is made via Git commits, ensuring traceability, consistency, and automated rollbacks."
  },
  {
    id: "faq13",
    level: "Advanced (6‚Äì8 months)",
    question: "How can I make my DevOps projects stand out to recruiters?",
    answer:
      "Document each project clearly ‚Äî add architecture diagrams, CI/CD flow, technologies used, screenshots, and lessons learned. Deploy live demos (even on free tiers) and share GitHub repos with detailed READMEs."
