    question: "What is Next.js and why should I learn it?",
    answer:
      "Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and building full-stack applications. Learning it makes you proficient in building high-performance, SEO-friendly web apps used widely in the industry.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I learn React before Next.js?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Next.js is built on React, so understanding React fundamentals like components, props, state, and hooks is essential before diving into Next.js.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the main features of Next.js?",
    answer:
      "Key features include: Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), API routes, image optimization, file-based routing, TypeScript support, and built-in SEO optimization.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Pages Router and App Router?",
    answer:
      "Pages Router is the traditional routing system in Next.js using file-based routing. App Router is the newer system supporting React Server Components, nested layouts, and advanced routing patterns for scalable apps.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I fetch data in Next.js?",
    answer:
      "You can fetch data using: getStaticProps (SSG), getServerSideProps (SSR), and client-side fetching (fetch or axios). Each method serves different use cases based on performance and SEO requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are API routes in Next.js?",
    answer:
      "API routes allow you to build backend endpoints directly within your Next.js app. They can handle requests like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE and are perfect for small backend logic without a separate server.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I deploy a Next.js application?",

    answer:
      "Yes, using TypeScript is highly recommended. It adds type safety, improves developer experience, and is widely used in professional Next.js projects.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I optimize performance in Next.js apps?",
    answer:
      "Use image optimization (`next/image`), lazy loading, static generation (SSG/ISR), caching strategies, code splitting, and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Next.js for full-stack applications?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Next.js supports API routes for backend logic, can integrate with databases, authentication, and even real-time features, making it suitable for full-stack applications.",
