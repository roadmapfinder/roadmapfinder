    question: "What is the difference between UI and UX design?",
    answer:
      "UI (User Interface) focuses on visual elements like colors, typography, and layout. UX (User Experience) focuses on the overall experience, usability, and how the user interacts with the product.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start a product design project as a beginner?",
    answer:
      "Begin with research: identify user needs, competitors, and pain points. Create low-fidelity wireframes, test flows, and gradually move to high-fidelity mockups and prototypes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the best tools for product design?",
    answer:
      "Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD for UI; Miro or Whimsical for wireframing and flow diagrams; Notion or Airtable for documentation and research tracking.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I make my designs accessible?",
    answer:
      "Follow accessibility guidelines like WCAG 2.2, use sufficient color contrast, provide keyboard navigation, alt text for images, and ensure readable typography.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a design system and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "A design system is a collection of reusable components, styles, and guidelines. It ensures consistency, speeds up design and development, and helps teams collaborate effectively.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I conduct user research effectively?",
    answer:
      "Use a combination of methods: interviews, surveys, usability testing, and analytics. Define goals, recruit representative users, and synthesize insights to inform design decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a wireframe and a prototype?",
    answer:
      "A wireframe is a low-fidelity layout showing structure and content placement. A prototype is an interactive, higher-fidelity version that simulates the final product experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I showcase my work in a portfolio?",
    answer:
      "Include problem statements, your research process, wireframes, prototypes, and final designs. Highlight your decision-making, iterations, and the impact of your design.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can prompt engineering improve AI-powered product design?",
    answer:
      "Prompt engineering helps AI tools generate content, UX copy, design ideas, and workflow suggestions. Well-crafted prompts guide AI to produce outputs aligned with user needs and brand voice.",
  },
