const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is Go and why should I learn it?",
        answer: "Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language designed for simplicity, concurrency, and performance. It’s widely used for backend services, cloud infrastructure, and distributed systems."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I install Go and set up my workspace?",
        answer: "Download Go from the official site (https://go.dev/dl/). Set up the PATH environment variable, and use modules (`go mod init`) for dependency management. The GOPATH workspace is mostly replaced by modules."
    },
    {
        question: "What are goroutines and channels?",
        answer: "Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime for concurrent execution. Channels are used to safely communicate between goroutines and synchronize execution."
    },
    {
        question: "How is error handling done in Go?",
        answer: "Go uses explicit error handling. Functions often return an `error` value that must be checked. There are no exceptions like in Java or Python, which encourages clear and predictable error handling."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between slices and arrays?",
        answer: "Arrays have a fixed size defined at compile time, while slices are dynamic, flexible views over arrays. Slices provide length, capacity, and allow easy append operations."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an interface in Go?",
        answer: "An interface defines a set of method signatures. Any type that implements those methods satisfies the interface implicitly. Interfaces enable polymorphism without inheritance."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I test Go code?",
        answer: "Go provides the `testing` package. Create `_test.go` files with functions starting with `Test` for unit tests. You can also write benchmarks and fuzz tests using `testing.B` and fuzzing support."
    },
    {
        question: "How do Go modules work?",
        answer: "Modules (`go.mod`) are the official way to manage dependencies. They specify project requirements and versions. Use `go get` to fetch dependencies and `go mod tidy` to clean unused ones."
    },
    {
        question: "When should I use gRPC vs REST in Go?",
        answer: "Use REST for simplicity and browser-based clients; use gRPC for high-performance, strongly-typed communication between microservices, streaming data, or low-latency requirements."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I deploy Go applications to production?",
        answer: "Compile your Go app into a static binary. Use Docker for containerization, deploy to Kubernetes or cloud platforms, set up CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logging, and observability with Prometheus/OpenTelemetry."
